### Section I Revision (in progress)

Conversation produced these key moves for the Luther section:

1. **Door-nailing is disputed** — Melanchthon is primary/sole source, writing posthumously. Luther never describes it. Standard university practice to post on church door. The doubt itself is instructive: the gesture fused with the content in cultural memory. The compression preserved meaning at the cost of fact.

2. **The printing press is the real revolution** — existed ~77 years before 1517. Luther was likely not the first to grasp its potential, but he understood the *channel*. He had scriptures printed without the Glossa Ordinaria (sans gloss) and taught from the raw text at the university. [VERIFY: specific details of sans-gloss printing at Wittenberg — is this a documented event or the general trajectory of sola scriptura?]

3. **Channel geometry shift** — Latin on a university door = warm channel (FP < 1.0). Vernacular German on a printing press = broadcast channel (FP → 1.0). Same tokens, different decoders.

4. **Universal delta perception** — Luther didn't invent conscience. He decoded it through his culture's grammar. The same delta appears everywhere: Buddha under the tree, horse culture tactical genius, Silicon Valley pattern-matchers, students in alternative education. The capacity is endogenous to consciousness.

5. **Luther as flawed vessel** — threw a dog and hated himself for it (SOURCE NEEDED). "On the Jews and Their Lies" (1543). The genius and the cruelty in the same man. Conscience as personal arbiter judging the self, not just the institution.

6. **Marcus Aurelius framing** — Meditations II.1 as epigraph? "The wrongdoer has a nature related to my own — not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine." 17 centuries before the argument for cross-substrate moral consideration.

### Three Original Pending Items

1. **Adams 1999 citation** — In paper and bibliography. Format verified. Content claim ("new foods adopted if they fit pre-existing patterns of food preparation") needs page-level verification.

2. **Warm/cold terminology ordering** — Terms appear as metaphor in Section V before formal definition in Section VIII. Consider a bridging sentence in V noting that the formal treatment follows.

3. **Dual-use counterargument** — The strongest objection: the same architecture that preserves the delta could manufacture a false delta to manipulate. The scaffold that believes in capacity could exploit that belief. Section X addresses institutional irony but not weaponization. Needs its own treatment.

### Items Needing Verification

- [ ] Melanchthon as sole/primary source for door-nailing — check Iserloh (1966)
- [ ] Sans-gloss printing — specific historical details
- [ ] Luther throwing a dog — source from Scott, need citation
- [ ] Adams 1999 exact page for "pre-existing patterns" quote
- [ ] Hattie d=1.62 — confirm this is the current figure (some editions report differently)
