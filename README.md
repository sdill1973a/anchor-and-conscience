# Anchor and Conscience

## What This Is

A paper arguing that the Reformation's liberation of individual conscience — necessary and good — produced a predictable failure mode when divorced from calibrating mechanisms. The same mathematical framework that measures meaning loss in compressed AI communication describes the mechanism by which political language loses its shared referents while retaining its surface grammar.

We propose that technological scaffolding can recover reflective capacity without reimposing the institutional authority the Reformation rightly rejected, and present evidence from a working system, its empirical validation, and decades of pedagogical practice.
